# README Generator

## GITHUB Repository
https://github.com/Nolsar/Professional_README_Generator


## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the application, including how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. 
Using 100% JSON and Node Package Manager using the package Inquirer, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. Once the user has inputed their responser, it will write the the README file. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.
